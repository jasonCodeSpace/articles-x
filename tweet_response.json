Countries across the world, including authoritarian regimes, have accused Israel of disproportionate force, war crimes, and even genocide. In the United States, while the federal government has remained largely supportive of Israel, prominent voices within media, academia, and political factions have echoed these accusations. This self-righteous posturing ignores the fact that faced with an existential threat on the scale of October 7, proportionally equivalent to multiple 9/11s for a small nation like Israel, virtually every country in modern history has responded with overwhelming severity, often deliberately targeting or accepting massive civilian casualties as collateral in pursuit of security.","type":"unstyled"},{"key":"d0dlh","data":{},"entityRanges":[],"inlineStyleRanges":[],"text":"The attack was not a conventional military incursion but a premeditated terrorist assault by Hamas and allied groups, involving crimes against humanity such as summary executions and sexual violence. Israel's subsequent operations in Gaza, aimed at dismantling Hamas's military infrastructure, have undeniably caused civilian suffering, but they occur in a context where the enemy embeds itself among non-combatants, making distinction nearly impossible.

The United States' reaction to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, which killed about 2,400 Americans, mirrors the shock Israel felt after October 7. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, authorizing the forced relocation and internment of over 120,000 Japanese Americans, two-thirds of whom were U.S. citizens. These individuals, including women and children, were uprooted from their homes on the West Coast, stripped of property, and confined in remote camps under harsh conditions, all based on unsubstantiated fears of espionage and sabotage.

Camps on the Isle of Man and elsewhere held detainees indefinitely without trial, with some deported to Canada or Australia under brutal conditions, such as aboard the HMT Dunera.

The U.S. firebombing of Tokyo on March 9-10, 1945, codenamed Operation Meetinghouse, unleashed over 1,600 tons of incendiaries, creating a firestorm that killed an estimated 100,000 civilians and destroyed 16 square miles of the city.

The raid, intended to disrupt German communications and aid the Soviet advance, created a firestorm that asphyxiated and incinerated residents in shelters.

Britain's conduct during the Second Boer War (1899-1902) set an early precedent for concentration camps as a tool of counterinsurgency. Facing guerrilla warfare from Boer fighters, British forces implemented a scorched-earth policy, destroying 30,000 farms and herding over 200,000 Boer women, children, and black Africans into camps. Conditions were abysmal: disease, starvation, and overcrowding led to the deaths of about 28,000 Boers, mostly women and children, and an estimated 20,000 black Africans.

Responding to the National Liberation Front's (FLN) independence struggle, which included terrorist attacks on French settlers, France deployed over 400,000 troops and employed torture, forced relocations, and aerial bombings. Civilian casualties numbered between 300,000 and 1.5 million Algerians, including massacres like the one at Sétif in 1945, where up to 45,000 were killed in reprisals.

Each round of violence is treated in isolation, but Israel’s experience is one of prolonged, existential siege. This context matters. Israel is not engaged in a campaign of conquest or expansion. It is defending its population, its cities, its children, its future, against a threat that is not only military but civilizational. And it does so as a state born in the shadow of genocide. A nation rebuilt by survivors of the Holocaust cannot afford to treat “never again” as merely a historical slogan.
