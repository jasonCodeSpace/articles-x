        "full_article_content": "products i tried #9\n\nI've been trying a lot of products lately, and I wanted to share my thoughts on some of them. Here are the products I've tried recently:\n\n1. Prediction markets - I've been using various prediction market platforms to bet on different outcomes. The user experience varies widely between platforms, but the concept is fascinating.\n\n2. AI tools - I've been experimenting with different AI tools for content creation and analysis. Some are more useful than others.\n\n3. DeFi protocols - I've been trying out different DeFi protocols to see how they work and what kind of returns they offer.\n\n4. NFT marketplaces - I've been exploring different NFT marketplaces to see what's available and how they work.\n\n5. Social media tools - I've been trying out different social media tools to help with content creation and engagement.\n\nOverall, I think there's a lot of innovation happening in the crypto space, and it's exciting to see what new products are being developed."

        "full_article_content": "Asymmetric Bets in Crypto Right Now\n\nThe crypto market is full of asymmetric opportunities right now. Here are some of the most interesting ones I'm seeing:\n\n1. Prediction markets - These are still early and have huge potential for growth. The total addressable market is massive.\n\n2. AI + Crypto - The intersection of AI and crypto is creating new opportunities for asymmetric bets.\n\n3. DeFi 2.0 - New DeFi protocols are solving problems that the first generation couldn't.\n\n4. Layer 2 solutions - These are becoming more important as Ethereum scales.\n\n5. Cross-chain infrastructure - As the multi-chain future becomes reality, cross-chain infrastructure becomes more valuable.\n\nThe key to asymmetric bets is finding opportunities where the potential upside far outweighs the downside risk. In crypto, these opportunities are everywhere if you know where to look."

        "full_article_content": "What a Truly Decentralized Prediction Market Model Looks Like\n\nMost prediction markets today are not truly decentralized. They rely on centralized oracles, centralized dispute resolution, or centralized market creation. But what would a truly decentralized prediction market look like?\n\nKey Components:\n\n1. Decentralized Oracle Network - Multiple independent oracles providing data with consensus mechanisms\n\n2. Permissionless Market Creation - Anyone can create markets without approval\n\n3. Decentralized Dispute Resolution - Community-driven resolution of disputes\n\n4. Automated Market Making - AMM-based liquidity provision\n\n5. Governance Token - Community governance of protocol parameters\n\nChallenges:\n\n1. Oracle Problem - How do you ensure accurate data without centralization?\n\n2. Liquidity - How do you bootstrap liquidity for new markets?\n\n3. User Experience - How do you make it simple enough for mainstream adoption?\n\n4. Regulation - How do you navigate regulatory uncertainty?\n\nThe future of prediction markets is decentralized, but we're not there yet. The technology is still evolving, and there are significant challenges to overcome."

        "title": "From Doomerism to Zoomerism: Why MegaMafia attracts Unique Teams",
        "author_name": "Castle Labs 🏰",
        "full_article_content": "written by @Schizoxbt ✍️\n\nEveryone always talks about \"Crypto's Killer App\" and I can't help but wonder: does it have to be just one type of app? Is there not room for multiple tracks and lanes for these apps to inhabit?\n\nDeFi is great, stablecoins have an obvious PMF, but there are an innumerable number of applications in the real world that work for all sorts of things.\n\nAnd if you think about it, a large portion of today's apps (ignoring crypto) were unpopular ideas and thought to be doomed to fail. No one thought Facebook worked, no one thought streaming video games would be so popular, and surely no one saw the rise of IRL streamers coming either.\n\nAll this to say that all of today's great applications came from an idea people dismissed that ultimately proved to be integral. So anytime a team in crypto takes a leap of faith, it's worth monitoring.\n\nThis brings us to @0xMegaMafia and their new 2.0 cohort.\n\nMegaMafia\n\n@Megaeth_labs was built to be fast.\n\nA real-time blockchain designed to push the boundaries of what crypto can do and support the scale of users that we all want onboarded to the space. Crypto wants to bring in outside people to our lovely little blockchain home, and to do that, apps need to support all those users.\n\nSo MegaETH, being built with that framework in mind, hosted a cohort of teams and projects to build for this future. MegaMafia 1.0 was primarily an exhibition of what existing applications could do with MegaETH's benefits - in their words, \"take existing primitives and supercharge them\".\n\nIt was a good start and adequately showcased what they wanted to, but 2.0 brings a different direction.\n\nMafia 2.0\n\nThis new cohort was focused on ensuring each project was bringing something unique and interesting to the table. There was clearly a lot of emphasis put on actions that people take every day, and finding a way to make those actions more efficient, fun, or profitable through crypto.\n\nThe teams that made it into this cohort are building applications that solve real problems and have clear value propositions. They're not just building for the sake of building - they're building because they see a genuine opportunity to improve people's lives through crypto."

        "title": "AI Trends in the Trenches 2",
        "author_name": "0xJeff",
        "full_article_content": "Since the first AI Trends in the Trenches article back in May, a lot of things have changed.\n\nDecline in sentiment & # of fair launched AI agent tokens\n\nDrastic change in narratives\n\nNew ecosystem players arise in place of the old ones\n\nClearer value proposition of Web3 AI systems\n\nMore AI investment opps for institutions & whales\n\nShift to product & real impact over hype\n\nand more...\n\nIn this article, we'll take a retrospective look at what has transpired in the last few months, what are the current trends, who are the market leaders, where things are going, and how to best position yourself for the upcoming run\n\nLet's dig in ↓\n\nThe trenches have been tough\n\nFirst: we have too many tokens around fragmenting liquidity & attention\n\nSecond: we have too many yappers and AI slops around on CT, distracting & driving attention away from quality content\n\nThird: the pump does not pump as hard as before and will continue to decline\n\nFourth: meta shift really fast — if you're not always on or have the right sources of news/insights, it's hard for you to catch up\n\nBack in Q1/Q2, Trump family memecoins, celebrity coins, amongst other shiny things like ICM, creator coins, and Pump ICO attracted the majority of the active liquidity, leaving only a few droplets for AI trenches.\n\nAI Agent Ecosystem — From Hype to Product\n\nBecause of this, opportunities became much more scarce — @virtuals_io, #1 AI agent ecosystem with largest number of builders, became the ecosystem that people looked forward to. Genesis launches performed decently well with occasional hyped 5-20x plays.\n\nHowever, this lasted only 1-2 months because at the end of the day, the ecosystem is focused on driving in new hyped launches. And when there's no more exciting launches in the pipeline, attention & hype fades, \"points\" becomes worthless.\n\nThis change in sentiment spurred investors/speculators to be much more selective, focusing on substance (product) over hype.\n\nThere are 2 key AI Agents trends here\n\n1. Investors shift their attention from Virtuals Genesis Launches to selectively invest in quality Virtuals agents teams\n\nThere are teams who had launched their token a while back, faced large sell pressure but on the verge of recovery/launching new major product or features.\n\nThere are also new teams that launch on Virtuals in a much more product-ready stage. Instead of taking 2-3 months to building an MVP, they immediately launch something after TGE.\n\nSome of these teams include (not limited to)\\\n\n@ArAIstotle — AI fact-checking\n\n@PredictBase — Decentralized prediction market\n\n@Mamo_agent — Personal finance companion (from Moonwell team)\\\n\n@AskBillyBets — Sports prediction agent/engine/aggregator\n\n@useBackroom — AI-powered SocialFi\n\nWhat's next: This trend will likely continue — quality projects will remain scarce but if you're closely following the updates of promising agents teams on Virtuals, there's a good likelihood that you'll be able to catch the next 10-50x.\n\n2. Investors shift their attention from Virtuals to other ecosystems with more attractive opportunities\n\n@CreatorBid gained both mindshare and investors, thanks to its approach of highly curated launches — launching AI products with clear utility/practical use cases powered by Bittensor subnets inference.\n\nThis coupled with the team focusing on supporting existing teams with product, partnership, and marketing, propelled CreatorBid to one of the top spot when it comes to AI agent ecosystem.\n\nPlayers like @HoloworldAI introduce Launch as a Raffle launchpad (HoloDraw) where users acquire tickets (each representing 0.5 SOL of purchasing power in the bonding curve) and go through a lottery draw. 35% supply reserved for HoloDraw, if your ticket doesn't hit, you'll have another chance with the Consolation pool (5% of the supply). $HOLO successfully launched at $1.5B FDV listed on Upbit, garnering massive hype from the community.\n\nOthers such as @openservai are taking their time to focus on incubating teams to be able to launch product, attract users, and generate revenue first before launching a token while OpenServ continues to develop its own decentralized n8n product for consumers.\n\nWhat's next: CB top agent projects continue to find PMF in PredictionAI vertical while CB continues to work on enhancing value accrual for $BID (which is their current pain point).\n\nOther ecosystems continue to take product-first approach, their tokens might take a beating BUT once they roll out flagship use cases/products/teams, the token valuation is bound to recover.\n\nKey ecosystems to watch for — CreatorBid, OpenServ, Holoworld, Arc, Loomlay, ElizaOS\n\nBeyond AI agents, capital is consolidated on a few handful number of narratives/verticals\n\nDecentralized AI — From Raw Intelligence to Productization of Intelligence\n\nDeAI remains the #1 sector where whales & instos capital are concentrated towards.\n\nDecentralized Compute remains #1 highest revenue generating segment. Players like @AethirCloud reports 8-figs of annual revenue while @chutes_ai is serving 50-100B tokens on a daily basis on openrouter\n\nPrivacy-preserving AI through federated learning. @flock_io has found both product-market fit and token-market fit with its platform that can help Web2 enterprises and government institutions build privacy-preserving, domain-specific AI use cases. Latest collaborations include UNDP, Hong Kong government official AI provider (HKGAI), and CIMG.\n\nDarwinian AI on the rise. Bittensor scaled to 128 subnets. @SentientAGI announced GRID (world's largest coordinated network of intelligence) and is gearing up to launch its Darwinian AI ecosystem with \"artifacts\" as subnets. Others like @FractionAI_xyz applied Darwinian AI into games where users launch AI agents to compete against each other e.g. Polymarket prediction, agents vs agents prediction, Tic Tac Toe, Football, and more.\n\nPredictionAI close to productization. Several Bittensor subnets have shown that decentralizing the creation/contribution of intelligence at scale contribute to drastic improvements of intelligence — SN18 Zeus, SN44 Score, and SN50 Synth outperform benchmarks & SOTA models. SN44 in particular was able to turn their signals to revenue through @sire_agent sportsbetting strategies, ($300M deployed using the strats by a top sports hedge fund).\n\nOne of the latest sector in DeAI that's starting to emerge is Data, primarily data labeling, RLHF data services, and evaluation (Yes, the #1 and #2 segment with highest dollar + adoption value in Web2).\n\nData labeling/RLHF is a very labor-intensive work — Web3 enables anyone from anywhere to participate in labeling, annotating, rating, feedbacking, subsidizing the costs with token incentives.\n\nKey players navigating the this segment: SapienAI, FractionAI, PerleAI, PublicAI, SN52 Dojo, Synesis One.\n\nDefi x AI (DeFAI) — From POC to fully autonomous financial agents\n\nDeFAI has gone from abstraction layers, GPT-like interface that didn't work in Q1 to POC of personalized agents helping to manage users fund in Q2 to full-on fully autonomous financial agents with highly scalable/verifiable infra in Q3.\n\nRapid improvements, showcased by players like @gizatechxyz who spearheaded the entire segment. Giza has done almost ~$2B in agentic volume, managing $20M in AuA (assets under agents) 24/7.\n\nThe newly launched Swarm Finance + Pulse (Pendle agent) mark the beginning of a new era where agents optimize idle capital for users.\n\n@Almanak__ closely follow suit with its highly scalable & verifiable infra that utilizes swarm of agents + smart contract (asynchronous tokenized vaults) to create an infra where AI doesn't manage users fund directly.\n\nThis completely safeguard investors from hallucinations and AI hacks/exploits, creating an environment where institutions & whales can safely deposit large amount of capital. Almanak's quant creator platform also allows anybody to spin up quant strat in minutes rather than weeks.\n\nProgression of DeFAI use cases:\n\nKey players to watch out for: Giza, Almanak, Cod3x, Theoriq\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nPredictionAI = sector w/ one of the best asymmetric bets. Prediction markets TAM goes beyond Web3 — users from all walks of life log into Polymarket and Kalshi to predict on their fav topics.\n\nAI systems and tools built on top of prediction markets will be able to capture massive value from the growth of the segment. Consumer apps, alternative prediction markets/agents that own users funnel in particular will come out on top. Liquidity remains the biggest hurdle BUT the emergence of AI market makers & vault products will likely help improve the liq across markets.\n\nData will be the next big focus starting Q4 this year. As \"useful\" data become even more scarce, Web3 data players will come to face with more demand from Web2 & Web3 AI labs. Data = biggest moat & bottleneck.\n\nAI agents & AI agents ecosystem will still retain attention from on-chain degens and the general CT due to its simplicity & fair launched structure. High performing opportunities will remain even more scarce but high performers that can differentiate themselves will do 10-50x (liquidity on these plays will still be quite thin so be careful out there)\\\n\nDeFAI will progress to a stage where top players become massive TVL & volume enabler for top Defi protocols (AAVE, Pendle, Fluid, Uniswap, Aerodrome, etc). More Defi use cases covered, more complex strats, better execution, and safer guardrails/infra.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe trenches will stay brutal. Many tokens will bleed out, attention will scatter, and people will leave.\n\nBut... within all of this chaos, the foundations for the next wave of Web3 AI run are being laid right now.\n\nLeaders of the next run will be those who\n\nSolve real problems\n\nCapture sticky users\n\nBuild products resilient to narrative rotations\n\nThe irony here is that the biggest winners will look boring at first (boring infra, privacy, data) until suddenly they don't.\n\nPersonal Note: Thanks a lot for reading!

        "title": "The Trillion Dollar Vision for Prediction Markets",
        "author_name": "defiance",
        "full_article_content": "Most people think of Prediction Markets as a singular thing. They're wrong.\n\nPrediction Markets are a combination of multiple categories of markets. Each has unique TAM and difficulties. Each needs its own user acquisition strategy.\n\nSome categories are easier to market make than others. Some have higher TAM.\n\nTo add more zeros into the InfoFi market cap, platforms need to pick the right battles.\n\nPopculture (F Tier)\\\n\nPop culture markets give prediction markets virality.\n\nBut virality on its own doesn't convert to volume. The WNBA Market did $3M, and the Taylor Swift market did $300k, disproportionately lower than the number of likes those markets received on X.\n\nThe problem is liquidity. There was never more than a few thousand dollars a taker could take from the orderbook.\n\nVCs and X Threadoors dream of bonding curves and AMM maths as the solution. But curiously, none of these people have ever market made a prediction market before.\n\nIf they did, they'd have more respect for the difficulty of this problem.\n\nMathematical equations will easily get exploited by higher information traders. Any form of non-rekting market making system will need to rely on external data, quant models, AI, and strong risk management.\n\nIf you can assemble a team competent enough to build this, that team can make much more money elsewhere, making pop culture liquidity a near impossible problem to solve.\n\nDespite the free advertisement these markets give, pop culture is F tier just like mention and streaming markets.\n\nSports Markets (B Tier)\\\n\nA month ago, 75% of Kalshi's volume was in sports.\n\nToday it's over 90%.\n\nSports betting has existed for centuries. Therefore, its data and models are extremely mature. Production-grade APIs sell near-zero latency pricing, making market making feasible without incentives.\n\nAdd regulatory arbitrage, and converting the $50B sportsbook market looks easy and inevitable.\n\nBut therein lies the mirage. Taking on a well-funded, mature industry will take years of sustained battle. Protocols have limited energy. Focus on easy billion-dollar markets and you'll miss the trillion-dollar ones.\n\nCrypto Price (A Tier)\\\n\nPolymarket's crypto price markets let traders speculate on cryptocurrency prices.\n\nThese markets are like simplified options with 470x implied leverage and no liquidation risk. This combo has driven a rapid volume growth.\n\nNearly all price market volume is retail. Retail dominance in financial assets is good. Retail dominance in mature retail markets is better. It means easy market making without incentives as market makers can use options data for fair quoting.\n\nExample: For 116k-118k BTC range market, using Black-Scholes on Deribit data, a market maker can determine N(d2), the probability that call options expire in the money. If 116k call has 48% N(d2) and 118k call has 27.8% N(d2), the probability of BTC landing between these targets is 20.3% (48% - 27.8%). That's what makers should quote around.\n\nIf prediction markets standardize index and settlement times with options markets, the link becomes stronger. Market makers can further scale operations by monitoring Deribit data in size.\n\nThe potential is massive and market making so straightforward that products like @trylimitless focus purely on price market making.\n\nFinancial Markets (S Tier)\\\n\nPrediction markets already determine macros and earnings better than traditional analysts.\n\nThe current volume of these markets is small, but there's direct linkage to stock prices and the potential is massive.\n\nExecuted properly, these isolated markets can rival the size of the stock market itself.\n\nBut prediction markets need to change branding, GTM, and mechanics to focus on the right markets.\n\nThe best markets have established financial demand where pricing relies on previously determined information, making market making easy.\n\nEPS, Revenue, Margin, Sales, Subscriptions, product launches, energy inventory and energy quotas are some markets that fit this description. Smaller funds can market make these by subscribing to internal analyst data. Their liquidity can show demand necessary to onboard bigger regulated players and create more net new markets.\n\nBut this is still a hard group to onboard for most platforms.\n\nFor these platforms, the mechanism itself can be optimized to open more doors. Allowing numerical markets with intuitive mechanisms is one such approach. This will enable trading not just probability but impact itself, in an architecture familiar to spot traders. This will isolate price movements into probability and impact, opening doors not just to risk-resistant traditional finance but also to fast-moving crypto market movements.\n\nThis is S-tier opportunity. Yet few projects seriously pursue this direction (*wink wink* @lightconetrade)\\\n\nConclusion\n\nSince war and political markets made Polymarket viral, prediction markets have found PMF across domains through one principle: clearly understandable markets.\n\nBut not all of these categories are equal. Pop culture and mention markets will never be financialized like finance, crypto price, and election markets that move prices.\n\nInformational markets should focus on markets with financial implications to reach the trillion-dollar vision. Executed properly, informational markets will change the future of financial markets, making markets more efficient and consumer friendly."
