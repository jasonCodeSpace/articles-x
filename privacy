Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 4, 2025

Who We Are

Xarticle (“Xarticle”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is a website that curates links to long-form articles shared on X and across the web, and provides AI-generated summaries and organization. Xarticle is operated by an individual (the “Operator”). You can contact us at hi@xarticle.news
.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use https://www.xarticle.news/
 (the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to the practices described here.

Scope

This Policy applies to the Service and related web features. It does not apply to third-party websites that we link to or embed.

Information We Collect
1) Information You Provide

Account Information: email address, authentication data.

Profile/Preferences: display name, reading settings.

Bookmarks/Lists: articles you save or organize.

2) Information Collected Automatically

Technical Data: IP address, browser type, device/OS, referring URL, pages viewed, time spent, and similar diagnostics.

Cookies and Similar Technologies: essential cookies (authentication, security), preference cookies (e.g., language), and analytics/performance cookies.

3) Public/Third-Party Sources

Public Content: We collect and curate publicly available information from X and other sites (e.g., titles, snippets, author, publication date, article URLs and metadata) strictly for curation, summarization, and navigation purposes.

How We Use Information

Provide the Service: operate, maintain, and secure core features (authentication, bookmarks, preferences).

Personalize & Improve: remember your settings; measure usage to improve performance, relevance, and reliability.

Communications: send service notices (e.g., policy updates, account alerts) and respond to inquiries.

Safety & Compliance: detect and prevent abuse, fraud, and security incidents; comply with legal obligations.

Our Legal Bases (EEA/UK where applicable)

Contractual Necessity: to create and maintain your account and provide core features.

Legitimate Interests: to secure and improve the Service; to curate publicly available content from X; to measure performance. We balance these interests against your rights and expectations.

Consent: for non-essential cookies/analytics and optional communications. You can withdraw consent at any time via cookie settings or unsubscribe links.

Legal Obligation: to comply with applicable laws and enforce our terms.

Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use:

Essential Cookies (required for authentication and core functionality),

Preference Cookies (remember your settings), and

Analytics/Performance Cookies (under your consent where required).

Managing Cookies: You can control cookies in your browser. If we provide a Cookie Settings link in the footer, you can change non-essential cookie preferences or withdraw consent at any time. Disabling certain cookies may affect functionality.

Analytics

We use analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand usage and improve the Service. Where available, we enable IP anonymization and disable data sharing with advertising products. You can opt out via browser controls and the Google Analytics Opt-Out Add-On. See your browser’s help pages for managing tracking technologies.

AI, Summaries, and Profiling

We use machine learning to summarize, classify, and organize content. We do not make decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects solely based on automated processing. Where applicable, you may object to profiling used for analytics or personalization.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell or rent personal information. We also do not “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising (as defined by California law). We may disclose information only in these situations:

Service Providers (Processors): hosting/infrastructure, analytics/monitoring, email delivery, and AI processing. They act under our instructions and appropriate safeguards.

Legal/Compliance: to comply with laws or lawful requests; to protect rights, safety, and security; to enforce our Terms.

Business Transitions: if the Operator transfers the Service (e.g., merger, acquisition, sale of assets), information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

If we maintain a public list of processors/sub-processors, it will be linked on the site (e.g., /subprocessors).

International Data Transfers

Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we rely on safeguards such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum (IDTA), plus supplementary measures as appropriate. A copy or summary of these safeguards is available upon request.

Data Security

We implement technical and organizational measures, including encryption in transit and at rest (where applicable), access controls, and monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We maintain incident-response procedures and, where required by law, will notify you and/or regulators of a personal-data breach without undue delay.

Data Retention

We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, then delete or anonymize it unless a longer period is required by law. Typical periods are:

Account & Profile: for the life of the account; deleted or anonymized within 30 days after account deletion unless legal retention applies.

Security Logs: up to 90 days.

Analytics Data: up to 13 months (or shorter where required).

Support/Communications: up to 24 months after resolution.
We may retain minimal records to comply with law and demonstrate compliance.

Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing (including profiling for analytics/personalization), withdraw consent, and receive a portable copy of your data. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

How to exercise your rights: email hi@xarticle.news. We will verify your request. We respond within 30 days for EEA/UK requests and within 45 days for applicable US state requests (an extension may apply where reasonably necessary). We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

US State Privacy Disclosures (e.g., California)

We do not sell personal information for money and do not “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. We honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals where applicable. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes that require a right to limit under California law.

Children’s Privacy

The Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. For users in the EEA/UK, we do not knowingly process personal data of children under the applicable digital consent age (typically 16, or as set by local law) without verifiable parental consent. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us so we can delete it.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide reasonable notice (e.g., banner or email) and indicate the effective date. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
